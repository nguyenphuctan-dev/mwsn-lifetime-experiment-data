# Experiment data

Experiment data for the paper "A heuristic node placement strategy for extending network lifetime and ensuring target coverage in mobile wireless sensor networks".

We run each scenario with various test sets. Each test set contains the locations (x- and y-coordinates) of the targets and sensors.

- Scenario 1.1 and 1.2: 200 test sets (from `test0` to `test199`)
- Scenario 2.1, 2.2 and 2.3: 30 test sets (from `test0` to `test29`)

For example, in instance `S1-1-1`, there are 30 targets and 75 sensors. In each test set, the locations of targets are represented by the first 30 rows in file `targets.csv` and the locations of sensors are represented by the first 75 rows in file `sensors.csv`.
